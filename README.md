# Car-Price-Predictor

#### Car Price Predictor Machine Learning Model which predicts the price of the second-hand car after taking relevant input features
This is a machine learning project that predicts the price of a car based on its features. The project uses a dataset of car features and prices to train a regression model. Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the price of a car based on its features.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Car Features and MSRP dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about various car models, including features such as engine size, horsepower, and fuel efficiency, as well as the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP).

## Requirements
This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries:

- **numpy**
- **pandas**
- **scikit-learn**
- **seaborn**
- **matplotlib**
