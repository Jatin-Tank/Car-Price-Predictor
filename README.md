# Car-Price-Predictor

#### Car Price Predictor Machine Learning Model which predicts the price of the second-hand car after taking relevant input features
This is a machine learning project that predicts the price of a car based on its features. The project uses a dataset of car features and prices to train a regression model. Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the price of a car based on its features.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Car Features and MSRP dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about various car models, including features such as engine size, horsepower, and fuel efficiency, as well as the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP).

## Requirements
This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries:

> **numpy**
> **pandas**
> **scikit-learn**
> **seaborn**
> **matplotlib**

## Areas of Usage
- **Car Dealerships:** Car dealerships can use this project to predict the price of a car based on its features. This can help them set the right price for the car and make informed decisions while negotiating with customers.

- **Insurance Companies:** Insurance companies can use this project to estimate the value of a car and determine the insurance premiums for the car.

- **Car Buyers:** Car buyers can use this project to get an estimate of the price of a car based on its features. This can help them negotiate a better deal with the seller.

- **Car Manufacturers:** Car manufacturers can use this project to analyze the demand for different car models and determine the optimal prices for their cars.

- **Automotive Researchers:** Automotive researchers can use this project to study the impact of different features on the price of a car and identify trends in the automotive industry.
